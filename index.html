            <h2>Private Dog Training</h2>
            <p>
              Every dog is different and so I can provide personal one-to-one
              training for your dog to help you get the most out of its
              training.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can take on private training of puppies and older dogs, to train
              the dogs to do the things that are important to you so that you
              have the best relationship possible and can enjoy walking and
              playing with your dog.
            </p>
            <p>I can also address a range of behavioural issues.</p>
            <p>
              Based in Keynsham but being local to Bristol and Bath, we can run
              sessions at your home, or in a park or other suitable public place
              as necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              A standard one to one with me is £50 for an hour session but if a
              longer first session is required this can be accommodated.

            <h2>Obedience Classes</h2>
            <p>
              I run group training classes for puppies, beginners, and more
              advanced dogs. I previously ran the Kennel Club Good Dog Scheme
              but now operate my own “K9 Guss award scheme” whereby Certificates
              of achievement are awarded in the categories detailed below.
            </p>
            <p>
              My classes are in blocks of 5 weeks. £75 for the block with the
              option of doing a follow on block afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Classes are 45 minutes in duration. My venue is on Woollard lane
              on the Outskirts of Keynsham. I have use of a large fully enclosed
              grass paddock, sand covered horse riding arena and a large barn.
              There is ample parking and room for people to watch.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the course we will cover the following: Heeling on and off
              lead, recall, including around other dogs, sit, down, stand, good
              behaviour around other dogs, socialisation with dogs, people,
              noise and different surfaces, some simple age appropriate agility.
              I aim to have between 5 and 8 dogs in each class. To attend the
              dog needs to have completed / be up to date with its vaccinations.
            </p>
            <p>
              I run classes all day Saturday and Sunday and in the summer months
              on Tuesday evenings

                <h4>Assistance Dog Training - Dexter</h4>
                <p>
                  In 2014 I was approached by Felicity, a young lady living in
                  the heart of London who has <strong>Epilepsy</strong> and
                  experiences what she described as vacant seizures. She had
                  been trying to get an assistance dog to give her security and
                  assistance as she was vulnerable when having seizures. The
                  procedure was proving very challenging due to the criteria
                  potential assistance dog handlers have to meet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We discussed her requirements and agreed to work together to
                  provide her with a <strong>seizure response dog</strong>.

                  <p>
                    I found a suitable dog,
                    <strong>a nice natured 14 month old black labrador</strong>
                    dog and with the agreement of Felicity began training him.
                    Initial training was focussed heavily on environmental work
                    and basic training (he did like to pull on the lead). I then
                    moved on to specific assistance training which included
                    <strong>lying with me when simulating a seizure</strong>,
                    locating and fetching a handbag and mobile phone on command.
                    I was in regular contact with Felicity including trips to
                    London to ride the train, tubes and buses.

                    In February 2015 Felicity collected her new dog and has had
                    him as an assistance dog since then. He has been a great
                    success and has begun to
                    <strong>detect oncoming seizures</strong> alerting Felicity
                    who can get herself to a suitable location before it
                    happens. I enjoy receiving updates from Felicity as
                    <strong>their relationship grows</strong> and am very proud
                    to have been able to make a difference to her daily life,
                    helping to improve her independence.

                <h4>Wellbeing Dog Training - Rex</h4>
                <p>
                  In the summer of 2017,
                  <strong>I was contacted by Steve</strong> who wanted a dog to
                  be a wellbeing dog for his 14-year-old son Tom, who has
                  Autism. Again, difficulties matching the necessary criteria
                  made obtaining a dog through a charity problematic. We
                  discussed the type of dog they were after and what they were
                  hoping it would provide. We agreed to
                  <strong>work together</strong> to get Tom that special friend.

                    Steve was keen to have the dog trained from a puppy. Tom was
                    clear he wanted a Yellow male Labrador -
                    <strong>nothing else would do</strong>. I found a lovely
                    litter of puppies in Bodmin, Cornwall that included four
                    Yellow boys. I had my Father give the litter the once over
                    before travelling down to see them myself. I spent some time
                    viewing and playing with them before settling for "Mr Brown”
                    (they all had different coloured collars). From that moment
                    <strong>Mr Brown became Rex</strong> and I collected him 2
                    weeks later on 23rd October 2017.

                  <p>
                    Training went <strong>really well</strong>. Rex completed
                    the majority of his environmental training in the first few
                    weeks and became comfortable with most things including
                    noise, traffic, people and other animals. We worked hard on
                    his <strong>basic training</strong> keeping it fun and
                    happy. He is a lovely dog full of character. In May 2019 Rex
                    went to live with his new family and became that special
                    friend Tom and his Dad Steve were looking for.
