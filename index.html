                            <p>In 1998 I realised a life long ambition by becoming a Police Dog handler. I worked German Shepherd general purpose dogs and a Springer Spaniel specialist search dog for a total of 11&nbsp;years. During this period I was lucky enough to work with and learn a great deal from Andrew Lloyd who was the National Police dog Champion in 1999.</p>
                            <p>I also represented the Avon and Somerset Police at Police Dog Trials several times, winning the South West and Wales Regional Obedience trophy twice as well as trophies for Searching and Criminal Work.</p>

                    <p>
                        <span>I can take on private training of puppies and older dogs, to train the dogs</span>&nbsp;to do the things that are important to you so that you have the best relationship possible and can enjoy walking and playing with your dog.

                    <p>
                        <span>To get to know you and your Dog, I hold a consultation session with you to find out what sort of things you are looking for and to understand how best to train the dog. This session lasts about 90 minutes and costs £45. After the consultation, each session&nbsp;costs&nbsp;£30 and last 60 minutes.&nbsp;</span>

                            <p>In 2014 I was approached by Felicity, a young lady living in the heart of London who has <strong>Epilepsy</strong> and experiences what she described as vacant seizures. She had been trying to get an assistance dog to give her security and assistance as she was vulnerable when having seizures. The procedure was proving very challenging due to the criteria potential assistance dog handlers have to meet.</p>
                            <p>We discussed her requirements and agreed to work together to provide her with a <strong>seizure response dog</strong>.</p>

                                <p>I found a suitable dog, <strong>a nice natured 14 month old black labrador</strong> dog and with the agreement of Felicity began training him. Initial training was focussed heavily on environmental work and basic training (he did like to pull on the lead). I then moved on to specific assistance training which included <strong>lying with me when simulating a seizure</strong>, locating and fetching a handbag and mobile phone on command. I was in regular contact with Felicity including trips to London to ride the train, tubes and buses.</p>

                                <h5>The results</h5>
                                <p>In February 2015 Felicity collected her new dog and has had him as an assistance dog since then. He has been a great success and has begun to <strong>detect oncoming seizures</strong> alerting Felicity who can get herself to a suitable location before it happens. I enjoy receiving updates from Felicity as <strong>their relationship grows</strong> and am very proud to have been able to make a difference to her daily life, helping to improve her independence.</p>
